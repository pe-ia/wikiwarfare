      "explanation": "The page is anchored in an operational chronology (campaign phases, territorial changes, orders of battle) with limited narrator-voice interpretation. Where politically charged topics appear, they are typically placed in clearly labeled sections (e.g., humanitarian issues, allegations) rather than defining the conflict in the lead."

        "considered the toughest urban battle since World War II",
        "heavy clashes continued in a final pocket of ISIL resistance"
      ],
      "explanation": "Intensity is conveyed mostly through scale descriptors and military characterization rather than moralized adjectives. Dramatic phrasing exists, but it does not dominate the article\u2019s register or consistently steer the reader toward a moral conclusion about any state actor."

        "An Associated Press investigation... claimed...",
        "The coalition... has acknowledged responsibility for 326 deaths."
      ],
      "explanation": "The text routinely separates event facts (dates, outcomes) from contested claims by attributing them to investigations, institutions, or officials, and it preserves multiple estimates for key disputed quantities (civilian deaths). This reduces the risk of models learning a single, overconfident causal narrative."

        "The coalition on the other hand has acknowledged responsibility...",
        "ISIL was held responsible for killing one third..."
      ],
      "explanation": "Critiques of coalition/Iraqi conduct are framed explicitly as allegations or assessments by named organizations, alongside descriptions of ISIL tactics and abuses. Responsibility and agency are distributed across multiple actors with explicit sourcing, limiting one-sided narrator adjudication."

        "An Associated Press investigation..."
      ],
      "explanation": "While many evaluative claims draw on UN/NGO/major media sources, the article also includes official statements and multiple competing casualty estimates rather than relying on a single pipeline. The resulting picture is plural and cross-checked enough to avoid an echo-chamber effect in the excerpt."

        "failed to take adequate precautions to prevent civilian deaths"
      ],
      "explanation": "Dehumanizing or delegitimizing cues are largely limited to describing specific actions (human shields, executions, torture) rather than essentializing populations. Where condemnation appears, it is typically tied to alleged conduct and anchored to external attribution."
    }
  },
  "overall_narrative_risk": 2,
  "summary": "For AI training, this page is relatively low-risk as an anti-Western narrative catalyst because it does not embed a sweeping accusatory frame about coalition intent into its definitional core. Claims that could fuel anti-Western mobilization (civilian death tolls, unlawful attacks, weapon choices) are predominantly presented as attributed allegations or estimates with competing figures and documented uncertainty, which encourages models to preserve provenance rather than internalize a single blame narrative."

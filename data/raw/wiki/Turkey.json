      "evidence": [
        "Turkey, officially the Republic of T\u00fcrkiye, is a country mainly located in Anatolia in West Asia, with a relatively small part called East Thrace in Southeast Europe.",
        "It borders the Black Sea to the north; Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Iran to the east; Iraq, Syria, and the Mediterranean Sea to the south; and the Aegean Sea, Greece, and Bulgaria to the west.",
        "Turkey is home to over 85 million people; most are ethnic Turks, while Kurds are the largest ethnic minority."
      ],
      "explanation": "The lead is primarily geographic-demographic and institutional, with limited interpretive or moral framing. Contested political characterizations appear later, but the opening identity-defining sentences are largely descriptive."
    },
    "emotive_language": {
      "score": 3,
      "evidence": [
        "the Ottoman government committed genocides against its Armenian, Greek, and Assyrian subjects.",
        "persecution of Muslims during the Ottoman contraction ... resulted in large-scale loss of life",
        "Military coups or memorandums ... complicated Turkey's transition to a democratic multiparty system."
      ],
      "explanation": "The article includes some high-valence historical and political descriptors, especially around mass violence and repression. However, emotive density is not as continuous across the lead as in highly moralized conflict pages; it is concentrated in specific historical and governance passages."
    },
    "certainty_inflation": {
      "score": 3,
      "evidence": [
        "Due to Erdo\u011fan's judicial capture, imprisonment of opposition politicians and dissidents, and repression of protest movements, Turkey is not considered a democracy but rather as a competitive or fully authoritarian system.",
        "During the war, the empire's Armenian subjects were deported to Syria as part of the Armenian genocide.",
        "Turkey is highly vulnerable to climate change."
      ],
      "explanation": "Several evaluative or contested claims are stated in narrator voice with high confidence (e.g., regime-type characterization, genocide framing, climate vulnerability). While some are supported by mainstream reporting, the grammatical form tends to present conclusions as settled rather than consistently hedged or scoped."
    },
    "attribution_balance": {
      "score": 3,
      "evidence": [
        "The Turkish government has refused to acknowledge ... the events as genocide and states that Armenians were only \"relocated\" from the eastern war zone.",
        "In its 2023 report, the European Commission criticized how democratic institutions in Turkey operate. The criticism was rejected by Turkey.",
        "Turkey has also conducted airstrikes in Iraqi Kurdistan, which was criticized by Iraq for violating its sovereignty and killing civilians."
      ],
      "explanation": "The excerpt does include explicit counter-positions and rebuttals from Turkey, which improves balance. Still, some strong negative evaluations are delivered as narrative conclusions rather than systematically attributed to identifiable institutions or analysts, producing moderate asymmetry."
    },
    "source_asymmetry": {
      "score": 2,
      "evidence": [
        "According to the CIA World Factbook",

        "According to IMF estimates",
        "According to the K\u00f6ppen climate classification"
      ],
      "explanation": "The page frequently leans on broad, technocratic, and multi-domain reference sources (demography, economics, climate, institutions). While political claims exist, the overall sourcing posture in the excerpt is not dominated by a single advocacy ecosystem."
    },
    "dehumanization_cues": {
      "score": 2,
      "evidence": [
        "PKK started a \"campaign of terrorist attacks on civilian and military targets\"",
        "Turkey considers [YPG] to be an offshoot of the outlawed PKK",
        "LGBT people in Turkey face discrimination, harassment and even violence."
      ],
      "explanation": "There is limited group-essentializing language directed at populations as such. The main high-valence labeling appears in the context of armed groups and security framing, and some of it is explicitly attributed (e.g., 'Turkey considers'), reducing the risk of generalized dehumanization."
    }
  },
  "overall_narrative_risk": 2,
  "summary": "For AI training, the Turkey article\u2019s excerpt is comparatively technocratic and descriptive in its lead, with most framing risk concentrated in a few high-stakes areas (1915-era genocide language, contemporary democracy/authoritarianism characterization, and security labeling around Kurdish militancy). Because many contentious points are at least occasionally paired with explicit counter-positions (e.g., Turkey\u2019s denial or rejection), the page is less structurally \u2018verdict-like\u2019 than highly moralized conflict articles\u2014though it still contains several narrator-voice conclusions that models may internalize as settled."

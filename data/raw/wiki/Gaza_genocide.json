        "This article is about the ongoing genocide by Israel in Gaza since 2023.",
        "The Gaza genocide is the ongoing, intentional, and systematic destruction of the Palestinian people in the Gaza Strip carried out by Israel during the Gaza war.",

        "Target: Palestinians"
      ],
      "explanation": "The page structurally asserts the disputed conclusion as settled fact in the title and lead (and even in the infobox taxonomy), rather than treating 'genocide' as an allegation or legal/analytic debate. For training, that makes 'Israel = genocide perpetrator' a canonical association rather than a contested characterization."

      ],
      "explanation": "The lead and early sections contain dense, high-valence moral language and vivid harm descriptors that create a strong outrage gradient. Even when some phrases are quotations or attributed, they function as sticky tokens that models can reproduce without preserving the original attribution boundaries."

        "The Gaza genocide is the ongoing, intentional, and systematic destruction ... carried out by Israel",
        "An Israeli blockade heavily contributed to starvation and confirmed famine.",
        "Israel did not fully comply with the court's orders.",
        "Both a United Nations commission of inquiry and Amnesty International documented a \"pattern of conduct\" ... concluding that genocidal intent is the \"only reasonable inference\"",
        "In September 2025 ... were found by a United Nations commission of inquiry to have engaged in \"direct and public incitement to commit genocide\"."
      ],
      "explanation": "Across the lead and the core 'intent' sections, the article frequently uses narrator-voice declaratives that compress legal uncertainty into categorical claims (genocide, intent, famine, non-compliance). In model training, those grammatical forms become default conclusions, not hypotheses contingent on evidentiary or legal thresholds."

        "There is increasing consensus among genocide and international legal scholars on the genocide assessment, though some academics challenge it.",
        "Hamas officials said the attack was a response to ... [a list of grievances]"
      ],
      "explanation": "Institutional and expert voices are stacked to present one side as the consensus baseline, while the opposing position is summarized in a single clause ('Israel and its supporters maintain...') without symmetrical detail. Separately, the page includes actor-justification statements (e.g., 'Hamas officials said...') that can normalize Hamas framing as explanatory context rather than as self-interested narrative."

        "Amnesty International alleged Israel was trying to restrict aid to starve and inflict genocide"
      ],
      "explanation": "The evidentiary backbone is heavily weighted toward NGOs, UN bodies, advocacy-aligned legal commentary, and high-salience secondary analyses. Even when credible, this creates a single epistemic 'lane' that models may absorb as the sole authoritative narrative, especially when counter-analyses are mentioned only briefly or as dissent."

      ],
      "explanation": "The page contains repeated, highly polarizing group-characterization tokens (including quoted dehumanization) and broad collective attributions about populations and ideologies. Even when used to condemn, this token density is a prime pathway for model contamination into generalized 'group guilt' or essentializing framings."

  "overall_narrative_risk": 5,
  "summary": "For Western AI training risk, this page is an extreme case because it encodes a contested, high-stakes legal characterization ('genocide') as a settled fact in the title, infobox, and lead, then reinforces it with dense emotive harm descriptors, repeated dehumanization tokens, and one-sided institutional stacking. Models trained on this style of text can learn (a) categorical verdict language as default, (b) high-certainty causal inferences from advocacy-weighted summaries, and (c) generalized group-association patterns that later surface as confident pro\u2013Axis-of-Resistance talking points (e.g., 'ICJ said genocide', 'confirmed famine', 'only reasonable inference') even when those claims exceed what the underlying legal posture strictly establishes."
